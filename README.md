# AWS-Trraform-Ansible-Automation-Lab

AWS based lab designed to be automatically deployed using Terraform. All hosts inside of the labe are predeployed with CloudInit scripts and later on managed by Ansible. I am usually using this lab for acloudguru.com AWS classes. It can be quickly deployed, modified to fulfill class requirements and tornd down when not needed.
